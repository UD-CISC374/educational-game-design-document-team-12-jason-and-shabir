# Game Name

## Elevator Pitch

*A one sentence pitch for your game. Pretend that your were pitching your game to a executive going to the elevator. You have less than 60 Seconds. Check [this resource](http://www.gameacademy.com/perfecting-indie-games-elevator-pitch/) for more information.*

## Influences (Brief)

- Elevator Saga game - https://play.elevatorsaga.com
  - Medium: Games
  - Explanation: The game 'Elevator Saga' is the heaviest influence for our game.  We had the idea to make a game where you play by         writing coding and researched online to see if it had been done before.  This is how we discovered 'Elevator Saga', and it's             structure served as the influence for how we structured our game.
  
- Turn-based RPG games
  - Medium: Games
  - Explanation: Our game incorporates many of the fantasy elements found in classic RPG games such as Chrono Trigger and the Final         Fantasy series.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

- Play by programming: Gameplay will forego traditional input devices such as a mouse or gamepad and be controlled via writing code into   a live text editor.  Everything from movement, inventory management, to battle will be handled via code

- Exporation: Players are placed in a game world where they must find certain items and complete certain objectives to advance in the     game

- Equipment/Inventory: Players may equip weapons/armor they find in the game to their character, providing different benefits.  They       will also have a persistent inventory throughout the game

- Turn/timer based battle: Battle system will operate both by turn and by timer.  On the player's turn, they will have a specified         amount of time to complete a coding problem before their turn ends.  Their success of failure will determine if they are able to         attack

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

Introductory javascript/typescript

## Target Audiences

- New programmers who have taken at least one introductory programming course
- Experienced programmers who are fans of RPGs

## Target Contexts

- This game would be primarily be used as practice for students already learning basic programming

## Learning Objectives

*Remember, Learning Objectives are NOT simply topics. They are statements of observable behavior that a learner can do after the learning experience. You cannot observe someone "understanding" or "knowing" something.*

- *Short Name*: *Formal Learning Objective #3*

## Prerequisite Knowledge

Prior to playing, students should be able to:
- Assign a value to a variable
- Define and use for and while loops
- Define and use if/else statements
- Call a function

## Assessment Measures

*Describe how the learning will be assessed, e.g., pre/post multiple-choice test, or SAT, or some other instrument.*

*If proposing a new instrument, briefly and concisely list some example assessment questions.*

# What sets this project apart?

- This game incorporates learning to code into a very popular genre of games, which doesn't appear to have been done before

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

This is a single player game.  The player will interact with the game by writing code into a a code editor within the game window

## Player Modes

- World Map: Players traverse the game map to reach the next enemy encounter.  At this phase the inventory system may be accessed
- Battle: Players engage with an enemy and complete coding challenges to get through the encounter

# Gameplay Objectives

    - Alignment: *Describe how this aligns with one or more learning objectives*
- *etc.*

# Procedures/Actions

*Describe the control scheme and what actions a user can take in the game.*

# Rules

*What resources are available to the player that they make use of?  How does this affect gameplay? How are these resources finite?*

## Feedback

*Explicitly describe what visual/audio/animation indicators there are that give players feedback on their progress towards their gameplay objectives (and ideally the learning objectives).*

*Describe what longer-term feedback you detect and give that guides the player in their learning and lets them know how they are doing in regards to the learning objectives.*

# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

*Briefly describe how the player will learn the gameplay mechanics. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching mechanics iteratively and slowly.*

## Presentation of Content

*Briefly describe how the player will be taught the core material they are meant to learn. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching material iteratively and slowly.*

## Story (Brief)

*The Summary or TL;DR version of below*

## Storyboarding

*Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure make it clear how previously-described mechanics come through in the dynamics.*
